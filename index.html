 The potential project I would like to achieve is something directly related to my current workplace. 
I would like to develop a web-based form that integrates with a database to streamline to current 
process for custom orders and laybys in my workplace. In early stages, it would simplify system that 
better keeps track of orders and their current progress, with the aim to eventually add notifications 
and POS integration.  <br>
<br>
 We are currently using a very outdated, and almost archaic paper system for customer orders and laybys. 
 This system is prone to failure thanks to double handling and no set guide to how things should be done, 
 and no accountability. We have had many cases of confusion when a customer arrives to pick up their 
 order and it hasn’t had the payment processed, or hasn’t been built, and, in rare cases, was never ordered. 
 This, in the very least, is embarrassing for the business, but also frustrating for staff. I have no doubt 
 I can develop the required skills to design and develop such a system that would remove a lot of the room 
 for error that is currently in place with the current set up. 
<br>
 The current plan for the system would be to create a Web Based form that can be hosted on a local server, 
 run next to an online POS system that can be used when creating a layby or custom order for a customer. 
 In the early version it would require having all relevant information entered by the sales staff at the 
 time of the sale. Relevant information would include customer details, name, email address and mobile number. 
 This would be followed by the details of the order, brand, model, size, etc. After that it would move to 
 the current status of the payment. As orders require a 20% deposit, it would ask if this has been paid, 
 with only a yes/no answer available to the user. Depending upon that answer, the next pages would either 
 move onto the Order stage of the process or to ask for further information regarding the status of payment. 
 As this company uses bank transfers regularly for customer payments, if staff had selected “no” at the 
 Deposit Received section, it would then ask if they’re paying by bank transfer. Upon selecting Yes for 
 that, it would remind the relevant staff member daily to check the status of the incoming payment and 
 update it in the system. <br>
<br>
The rest of the system is intended to remove the room for error that stands in the current paper system 
by providing daily reminders to the relevant staff depending upon the status of the order. If the deposit 
or payment hasn’t been provided, it will remind the Accountant to check the status of the payment daily 
and update it as things change. Without the deposit supplied, it will not allow the order to transfer 
back to sales for the product to be marked as ordered from the supplier.  At this stage, it will remind 
sales staff to order the item, and mark it as ordered on the system, when it will transfer to the staff 
member in charge of managing incoming stock to mark it as arrived. From there, once the item has arrived, 
it will either remind sales to contact the customer to let them know it is in, or in the case of it 
needing to be assembled, to book it in with the mechanics for a build. <br>
<br>
There would be several conditional checks that would need to add to ensure correct operation. And if successful, 
I would like to see it turn into something more customizable for use in other businesses.  <br>
<br>
I would need a much greater understanding of web design and database construction, and how to integrate the two.
At the base level, a text editor, such as NotePad++ would be required to create the webform, and a database 
program such as Microsoft Access to create the database where relevant data would be stored and accessed from. 
It is still definitely an achievable goal at my current knowledge level, and with study and research, 
I’ve no doubt it could become a reality in time. <br>
<br>
The integration of this program into the business would resolve the current issues with the paper system 
and hopefully make things significantly easier when it comes to new staff coming on board. It’s a lot easier 
to train staff to use a program that basically holds your hand, compared to moving a piece of paper from 
bulldog clip to bulldog clip. Beyond the initial impact with this business, it could be a cost effect piece 
of software for smaller retail companies that deal with a lot of customer orders, although that would 
require customizing the options to suit each business. With time and more knowledge, I could see this 
becoming a basic software package, allowing the user to choose what options they need for their business, 
and allowing it run on a single machine. <br>
