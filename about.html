<h1 id="abouth1">About Me</h1>
<p id="aboutParagraph">
I was born and raised in NSW. I went to primary and high school in the lower Blue Mountains, where I completed my School Certificate, not my higher School Certificate. 
I left High School after year 10 to pursue an apprenticeship in motor mechanics, despite having an interest in IT in high school, and studying Information and Technology as an elective in years 9 and 10.  <br>
<br>
My apprenticeship was unsuccessful, and I have since had a very varied career. I have worked in many trades, including the automotive trade, electrical, air conditioning, hospitality, 
transport and logistics and currently in sales. I currently work as a sales person/mechanic at a bike shop in western Sydney.  <br>
<br>
I have a Welsh background on my mother’s side, and unknown origins on my Father’s. I speak English, with a few words of Japanese. My hobbies include: playing bass guitar, a little bit of gaming, 
and downhill mountain biking. In saying that, my last hobby has been an interesting one. Despite being a pretty adventurous rider in my high school days, I never broke a bone until my 28th birthday. 
On that day, I broke my clavicle in 4 places and a rib on my right side. This little accident has resulted in me getting a titanium plate on my right shoulder, which gives me steering issues when walking, 
thanks to a weight imbalance... Not actually true, but sounds almost believable, right? <br>

<h1 id="abouth1">Past, Present and Future in Information Technology</h1>
<p id="aboutParagraph">
My interest in IT began way back in my High School days, mostly from a close friend of the family who handled all our computer related stuff. I found that fascinating, despite not knowing much about it. 
I picked up many things during high school, although I can’t say I really learned a great deal while there. I have self-taught myself a few different skills in IT over the years. I started mucking around 
with 3d design and animation using 3dsMax when I was 19. At the same time I also developed a great interest in building computers. It was a lot of fun to design a system from the ground up, gather all of 
the parts and then watch it come together. From the 3 or 4 computers I built, I learned about overclocking to a small degree, with RAM and CPU. I never really gained a true understanding of bridge speeds, 
although it was next on my list at the time. My biggest pride of the time was a fully custom gaming PC that was running an overclocked i7, 64gb of RAM, with an SSD (which weren’t super common or cheap 
at the time) and dual graphics cards running in CrossFire. Unfortunately, it was an expensive hobby and real life caught up eventually.<br>
<br>
I have decided to study at RMIT as I have no real formal qualification, besides a certificate in transport and logistics, which doesn’t really interest me as a career. I want to build up the scattered 
foundations I’ve developed over the years and see if I can move my career path to something in an IT direction. RMIT has a great reputation in this field, and being something I can study from home, 
around work, it seemed like the perfect time to make a change in my life. <br>
<br>
I can’t say what exactly I expect to learn, it’s more what I hope to learn. I hope to solidify the foundations I have already, fill in a lot of gaps in my knowledge, and build upon them. I want to 
pick up more software related skills, as well as developing the ability to code in couple of languages if possible. I am interested in the smartphone app market, and eventually, I would like to be 
able to develop an application in that area, although I have no idea what, yet.<br>

<h1 id="abouth1" style="margin:20px;">My Current Dream Job in IT</h1>
<div id="sometext">

<p id="aboutParagraph">
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39141488?searchrequesttoken=2f40d3df-76ef-4724-a8bc-7175fecc9a99&type=standard"><b>IT Support Technician</b></a><br>
<br>
My ideal job, with what I know right now in regard to my goals and aspirations, would be an IT support Technician. This is a position that is currently beyond my current skill level, although I believe 
I would be qualified by the time I finish my studies, if lacking on the job experience. <br>
<br>
An IT Support Technician is a role that encompasses both software and hardware. It involves planning, setting up and maintaining networks for small to large business, as well as assisting the users 
with technical issues related to their machines and software. This sounds like a position I would quite enjoy as it covers a aspect of IT that I quite enjoy, hardware, as well as working with networks 
and interconnected software. On a practical aspect, it also offers to ability to gain experience in the industry. <br>
<br>
This position would require knowledge and experience in various types of software, from operating systems. Both installing and setting them up for different levels of users, to maintaining and 
troubleshooting any issues that arise. It would also require an understanding of the hardware requirements of this software, and the ability to install and network it together as required and 
maintain it from there.<br>
<br>
I would require excellent communication skills and the ability to work singularly and as part of a team. The ability to determine problems and resolve these issues. The job always requires an 
understanding, and experience, with various Windows based programs. <br>
<br>
I currently have a basic understanding on how to design a system to minimum and recommended hardware specifications, as well as installing and setting up the operating system. I have decent knowledge 
of some Windows based programs, with experience in troubleshooting problems. <br>
<br>
My current plan to build the skills and qualifications required by such as position is limited to completing this bachelor's degree with RMIT. Until I complete enough of this degree, I will not be 
able to identify where I am lacking and how to rectify these gaps in my knowledge. To that effect, there is extra-curricular activities I could do that would greatly assist my learning in the areas required 
by this position. There are various free online tutorials that deal with many Windows programs that would assist greatly with what I don’t already know, or struggle with currently. <br>

<h1 id="abouth1" style="margin:20px;">Personality Tests</h1>

<h2 id="abouth2">What is your Learning Style?</h2>
<p id="aboutParagraph">
The results of this test seem to gel well with what I know about myself and the way I learn new things. I prefer to see things in a diagram or example or hear what is being shown to gain a greater 
understanding the material. The results of this test wouldn’t really influence my behaviour in a team, as I can’t see that there would be any negative effect on the team. I function well from hearing 
and seeing examples. So when I am shown something or told something, I would be able to take it onboard and it would minimise potential issues with the team. <br>
<br>
In regard to becoming part of a team, I would ideally be suited to work with people who also quite visual, and like to come up with drawn example or diagrams detailing their intended plan. As well 
as working with people who are quite vocal. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h2 id="abouth2">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test</h2>
<p id="aboutParagraph">
I’m not all too sure of what to make of this test. It doesn’t really give me much information on the outside as to what it all means. From delving deeper into these results, I can see how the results 
apply to me and my personality, as well as giving myself a bit of a brutal reality check with some of my more obvious flaws, I’d rather not admit to. <br>
<br>
In very much the same way as the “Learning Style” test, I believe that this test shows that I would be able to work well in almost any team, as I’m easy going, and try to find enjoyment in any task I do. 
This would beneficial to the morale of the team, I would hope, and would in term benefit our productivity. <br>
<br>
It would also be important to take note when forming a team, that my personality may not do well with very introverted people and may make them uncomfortable. I realise that not everyone shares my outlook 
on life and things in general, so I try to minimize my outgoing side around people who obviously don’t enjoy it as much as others. <br>

<h2 id="abouth2" style="margin:20px;">Test My Creativity</h1>
<p id="aboutParagraph" style="margin:20px;">
I’m still trying to figure out how to translate this one. Although this test was quite enjoyable to complete, I can’t make sense of the results, so I wouldn’t know where to begin to explain what this test 
means to me, other than being complete gibberish. <br>
<br>
Because of the complete lack of understanding about what is going on in those results, again I wouldn’t be able to explain, let alone understand, what these results would signify about my ability to 
operate as part of a team. And with that in mind, I would completely disregard this data when considering the make up of a team. <br>
